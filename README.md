# Simple Robinhood Clone

## Brief Description

This is a simple Robinhood clone built with a full stack approach, featuring a Flask backend with SQLite for data storage and a React frontend using Chakra UI for styling. The application allows users to query stock information, buy stocks, view their portfolio, and get a portfolio review generated by OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Python 3.x
- SQLite
- OpenAI API Key

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:yuunji707/SellScale_Project.git
   cd Robinhood/backend
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the database:**

   ```bash
   flask db init
   flask db migrate
   flask db upgrade
   ```

5. **Run the backend server:**

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
