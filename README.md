 [Link to 30 second Demo](https://www.loom.com/share/447efdcdb04e4320bdd0bffd662abe65?sid=fd660284-bf4c-411)

## Brief Description

This is a simple Robinhood clone built with a full stack approach, featuring a Flask backend with SQLite for data storage and a React frontend using Chakra UI for styling. The application allows users to query stock information, buy stocks, view their portfolio, and get a portfolio review generated by OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Python 3.x
- SQLite
- OpenAI API Key

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:yuunji707/SellScale_Project.git
   cd SellScale_Project/Robinhood/backend
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the OpenAI API Key:**

   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
   - Add your OpenAI API Key to the `.env` file:
     ```env
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```

5. **Run the backend server:**

   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the frontend development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Detailed Description

### Backend

The backend of this project is built with Flask and uses SQLite for data storage. The backend provides several endpoints for querying stock information, buying stocks, viewing the portfolio, and generating a portfolio review using the OpenAI API.

- **Dependencies:** Flask, Flask-CORS, yfinance, SQLAlchemy, OpenAI API, and others listed in `requirements.txt`.
- **Database:** SQLite is used to store the portfolio information.
- **APIs:** The backend provides RESTful APIs to interact with the frontend and manage stock data.

### Frontend

The frontend of this project is built with React and styled using Chakra UI. It interacts with the backend APIs to provide a seamless user experience.

- **Dependencies:** React, Chakra UI, Axios, and others listed in `package.json`.
- **Components:** The frontend includes components for querying stock information, buying stocks, viewing the portfolio, and generating a portfolio review.
- **State Management:** The state is managed using React's Context API.

## Conclusion

This project is a simple example of how to build a full-stack application using Flask for the backend and React for the frontend. It integrates third-party APIs like OpenAI and yfinance to provide additional functionalities such as generating portfolio reviews and fetching real-time stock data.
